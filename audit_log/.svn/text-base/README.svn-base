AuditLog
========

the default rails log produces quite some output for each single request. this
audit log aim to produce a single line per request. further more the logged in user who triggerd the request is part of the log. with such a file a simple grep command you easily see what a specific user was doing in the system. beware that this "big brother" feature needs to be adjusted to obey your privacy laws and/or in responsible. but on the other hand it is a handy file for hunting user problems of your GUI or supporting user when problems araise.

Details
=======

this plugin add a few method to ActionController (the base for all the rails controllers):

log_message(msg, level = :info)

log_action(msg, level = :info)

log_exception(exception)

log(message, resource = nil)

for formating the resource you can overwrite the following method to your liking which is used with the log method. the log method has predefined log levels, so in case you need something else you need to use one of the other log_XXX methods:

resource_to_s(message, resource)

to configure the audit logger add following line into your rails initializer

require 'audit_log'
Audit::Logger.initialize(AUDIT_LOGGER)

where the AUDIT_LOGGER is any logger obeying the standard ruby logger interface. i.e. try logging.rubyforge.org

enjoy being a big brother ...
