CacheHeaders
============

when I heard about google web documentation (http://code.google.com/p/doctype/wiki/ArticleHttpCaching) I immediately put together this plugin, since I found it always cumbersome to find again and again the tricky details of caching. you can use it as a before filter or inside any action.


Example
=======

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  . . .
  before_filter :cache_headers

  include CacheHeaders

  # only browser can cache, no persistent storage and no max-age
  def cache_headers
    # max-age = 0, no-store = true
    only_browser_can_cache(true, 0)
  end
  . . . 
end

or the per action usage

  def index
    allow_browser_and_proxy_to_cache
    . . . 
  end 

all methods take a first argument "no_store" to allow persistence storage or not, default is false, i.e. persistencestorage is allowed.
