this is a clone of
http://erector.rubyforge.org/

I fixed a showstopper bug for running rails and added a generator for
resources. the generator is done to support datamapper.org as persistence
framework (use option --datamapper) and allows to use the guard plugin
(--guard).

the patch is posted and the generator I offered to erector until then I need a
working copy of the whole thing and that's where this project comes into play.
