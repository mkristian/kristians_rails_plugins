IMPORTANT
=========

I moved most of the code into the http://github.com/mkristian/ixtlan project under ixtlan-core. there you will find the idle-session-timeout, guard, unrestful-authentication, cache-headers, audit-log

the dm-rails and the datamapper_store moved to http://github.com/mkristian/datamapper4rails

the restful_transactions went into http://github.com/mkristian/rack_datamapper

the erector generators I am not using anymore - erector is still in flux and I wit until their API matures (and stablize).

act_as_fuzzy_search: hmm, do not think I will revive this anymore.

so please have look at these other projects in case you are looking for maintained code.
